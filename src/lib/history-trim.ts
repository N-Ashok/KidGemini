// Input-token diet for the chat model. The client sends the WHOLE conversation
// as history, and every assistant reply that built a game carries the full
// game HTML inline (~10-15K tokens per version) — so a kid iterating on a game
// re-sent every prior version on every message. This module trims what the
// MODEL sees (the stored conversation / UI is untouched):
//   1. Only the LATEST game's code survives — the model needs it to apply
//      "update" requests; older versions collapse to a one-line placeholder.
//   2. A sliding window keeps the last HISTORY_WINDOW messages, except the
//      latest game-bearing message is carried along if it fell outside, so
//      "now add a turbo" still has the code to work from after a long chat.
// Pure function — no I/O, no framework imports (extractArtifact is pure too).
